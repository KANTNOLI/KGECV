 This is one of my pet projects created for fun, this site has a soundtrack, beautiful animations, 2D games (Snake and numbers), visual and sound parameters. 
> This project was created using JS, React+ Redux, Vite (Project Builder), SCSS

- to launch the project, you need to:
- download the zip and unzip it in a convenient place
- go to VS code, **open the frontend folder**
- then use **ctrl + j** to open the console
- and write ```npm run dev``` (If the site is floating, **ctrl + mouse wheel**, it is not scalable and created for a **1k monitor**)
